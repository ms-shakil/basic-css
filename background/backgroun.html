        <p>The boomshakalaka from Stripes inspired its most
             noted use, in basketball. In the 1993 video
              game NBA Jam, the in-game commentator, voiced by
               Tim Kitzrow, uses over-the-top exclamations
                for big plays, especially boomshakalaka for
                 powerful slam dunks.
